# Creating an Endpoint<a name="endpoints-create"></a>

Create an endpoint on a channel to define how AWS Elemental MediaPackage prepares content for delivery\. Content can't be served from a channel until it has an endpoint\.

You can use the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS Elemental MediaPackage API to create an endpoint\.

For information about creating an endpoint through the AWS CLI or AWS Elemental MediaPackage API, see the [AWS Elemental MediaPackage API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/apireference/)\.
