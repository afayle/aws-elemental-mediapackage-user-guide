# \(Optional\) Setting Up Encryption<a name="set-up-encryption"></a>

Protect your content from unauthorized use through encryption\. Digital rights management \(DRM\) systems provide keys to AWS Elemental MediaPackage for content encryption, and licenses to supported players for decryption\.

To encrypt content, you must have a DRM solution provider\. Get set up by working with one of our AWS DRM solution providers\.
